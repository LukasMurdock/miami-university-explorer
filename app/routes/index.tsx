				I (<a href="https://lukasmurdock.com/">Lukas Murdock</a>)
				struggled every semester with two things: (1) finding what
				building my classes were in, and (2) looking up classes in the
				course list.

			<p>This seems dumb.</p>

				However, all Miami displays in BannerWeb are esoteric
				three-letter building codes. You have to know what they mean
				somehow.

				The{' '}

					Miami Course List

				doesn’t provide good defaults. It doesn’t provide any defaults
				actually.
